# cs50-PS-0
First problem set submission for CS50 using Scratch

Problem set requirements include:
- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game.

Idea: make a bat swatter game where the object of the game is to swat the bat with the cat with the following behavior:
- Upon start, a bat sprite appears from above and moves around at random
- the cat sprite tracks the cursor
- once the player starts moving the cursor the bat moves away from it
- when the cat position intersects the bat, the player scores a point and the bat starts from it's initial position
- as the score increases the bats movement could become faster and more erratic
